                                The Dunedin Museum of Natural Mystery is a small private museum and gallery based in the home of Dunedin mural artist and sculptor, Bruce Mahalski, and located at 61 Royal Terrace in central Dunedin. ​<br>

                                Spread over three rooms of an old central city villa, the museum contains a collection of skulls, bones, biological curiosities, ethnological art and unusual cultural artifacts which the artist has collected over a life-time. <br>
                                
                                There is also a gallery featuring the artist's trademark textural bone sculptures and paintings of animals on canvas. Sometimes there are also group shows by local artists. The Museum stocks a small collection of books and t-shirts as well as art and sculptures for sale. <br>
